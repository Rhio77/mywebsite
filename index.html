<h2>About Me!</h2>
<p>I’m currently 44 and residing in country South Australia. I live with my partner and our sixteen year old son. We have other children, ages ranging in thier early to mid twenties and they're all off doing things and just generally being good people.
  My interests involve anything except sport. I love reading horror and scifi, crocheting, creating art and staying home.
  I still live in the same city I attended high school which means I also spend my time avoiding mlms started by fellow classmates.
  Interesting fact about me, I dabbled in stand-up after high school, not as a career per se but more to disappoint my parents. It worked. They sent me to Uni to be an accountant. That didn’t last long either.</p>

<h2>Interest In IT</h2>
<p>My interest in IT started as a child, my dad was very interested in burgeoning technology, especially computers. Before then we have the latest in-home entertainment systems, the Beta VCR then the VHS. He never got into Laserdisc. Looked at it and laughed at how big the discs were. Our first computer was a Commodore 64 followed by the 128. Later, when I was in primary school, we had a dial up modem. It basically went from there. Part of my first grown-up pay was spent on a PlayStation One.
My past jobs have always centred around using computers. Social media and the internet are just a staple at this point. My dad passed away six years ago and now that I have the time and capability, I’m doing what I want to do.
My interest in attend RMIT stems from, once again, my dad. He had taken some RMIT classes when I was younger. When I started looking into Open Universities to see what my options were this course seemed like the best one available.
I want to learn the nuts and bolts of IT. I want to understand how it all works and hopefully find something I can be passionate about. I feel like my knowledge in computers and networking now is only at a rudimentary level and I want to take that next step. I want to learn about programming but I’m also keeping an open mind about what else could pique my interest.

<h2>My Ideal Job</h2>
<img src="Job1.jpg">
<p>Link https://au.indeed.com/jobs?q=programming&l=South%20Australia&vjk=ee658a1f2bb4400b</p>
<p>The position of Software Engineer with a company like the one listed in the advert interests me because I see so much software which has been designed to be tweaked and added to so that they can sell it to as many companies as possible. The result is a program that is neither user friendly nor intuitive. I am interested in creating software and mobility solutions for individual industries or businesses, tailor made to their requirements.
While I don’t necessarily have the exact skillset for this position now, by completing the Bachelor of IT and Programming further down the track, I will gain the required skills to do so.
One of the duties calls for an understanding of confidentiality, something I’m well versed in having worked for several government departments including SA Health and ARTC. I have a high level of concentration and attention to detail when working with data.

<h2>Personality Tests</h2>

<p>While this test can be described as somewhat correct, I feel that the results are too oversimplified. My attitude towards group work depends on many factors. Who am I working with? Do I feel like the outcome is achievable? Is everyone involved on the same level, are they going to put as much effort as possible into the project? Am I personally in the right frame of mind to be undertaking the work? Not every project is the same, not every group works together the same.</p>


<h3>Online Learning Style Test</h3>

<p>The fact I got a different result with this test, despite answering the questions is a very similar manner, doesn’t show me that they have much validity in many aspects, much less in a work situation. This one is a little closer to my work style though, I do find I get more achieved when I’m working by myself but I also value communication over anything else.</p>


<h3>Additional Online Test</h3>

<p>The results of these tests don’t mean a great deal to me. Some of the answers I gave made me realise that maybe I could afford to be more flexible with team members. I know I prefer to work alone but I’m also comfortable working in a team. The questions aren’t nuanced enough to drill down how any one person thinks or feels. It’s not going affect how I work or how I cooperate with people. I’ve been in the workforce for over twenty years, my experience overrides a ten minute test.</p>

<h1>Project Idea</h1>
<p>I had the idea for this app because its part of my job to deal with thousands of pieces of paper a year. It is an outdated mode of work. When mobility became common in the workplace for maintenance work orders I though “why can’t this be expanded to involve the rest?”.</p>
<p>Working in the rail industry, one of the most common complaints I hear about is too much paperwork. Each safe working form has its own book, the Safe Working Method Statement alone is split over two books, and there are two versions of one of those books, one for teams and one for individuals. Got a headache yet?  Some days there are at least four books to work with and at least three of those must be carried on site. Time is lost in the mornings because site maps must be drawn up, and details handwritten. Currently the track maintainers I work with have found it easier to photocopy and shrink a section of a network map and use various coloured textas to highlight the sections of their worksite.</p>
<p>I am proposing an app that can be implemented in mobility which contains electronic copies of all safe working forms required that can be filled in on site or enroute to site.</p>
<p>Sections of the form can be prefilled with, for example</p>
<p>•	The name of the person who has logged onto the app would be auto filled into the requester slot</p>
<p>•	The date the form is initiated would be auto entered as “Today’s Date”</p>
<p>•	The site map would be selected from a dropdown list of pre-existing network maps, which can then be altered to suit.</p>
<p>•	Noting where any heavy plant or vehicles will be working or parked can be marked with icons</p>
<p>Once use of these forms is completed and they are no longer required they can be closed and then saved to cloud based storage. Retrieval of these forms is not often required except for use of proof of prior knowledge in recertification of licences and in the unfortunate event of an incident which required investigation. The current storage system is that they are filed in hard copy format in folders. They are then put into archive for a lengthy of time. This is simply and inefficient way to store the files. If they are in a cloud-based storage system they could be accessed at ease by management or site coordinators without searching through folders or boxes.</P>
<p>It would also remove any issue of lost or damaged paperwork. Worksites can be hundreds of kilometres away and sometimes workbooks are one of the last things on the list to be concerned about.</p>
<p>Rail is not the only industry that has these types of forms that are mandated for use to meet requirements for safe-work legislation. The functionality of the app would remain the same across businesses, the forms would be the only change. The client would be responsible for setting up and maintaining their own storage system and a backup system.</p>
<p>Forms also differ between states. There are many forms which are solely for NSW, some just for South Australia and some only required in Western Australia. The location of the user could be used to filter which forms would be required for his worksite.<p/>
<p>Possible safety functions could also be included. When the area of the worksite kilometres are entered onto the form the app could have built in GPS, or work in conjunction with an existing app i.e. KM2ME, to ensure that the user is in or near the area they have committed their worksite to.</p>
<p>Contractors are often also hired to undertake safe-working capabilities. This app would cut back on them requiring taking loose forms or entire books if only two or three pages are required, and it would ensure that the completed paperwork is returned.</p>
<p>As the forms are updated to comply with government mandates regarding safe-working laws they can be automatically updated in the system and made available to all. The current system holds the individual offices responsible for making sure old or out of date paperwork is not used and the up-to-date version are supplied to publishers for printing.</p>
<p>Possible issues and ways to avoid them:</p>
<p>•	Lack of network available: there are blackspots that exist in outback areas where no internet capability is available. The only way around this would be to cache the forms until network becomes available.</p>
<p>•	Batteries on tablets running out: include an autosave function as the form is filled in so that new forms are not lost, and existing forms are up to date.</p>

<p>If the overall design of the app is kept simple to use and clean to look at, I think it would be very successful in industries that aren’t perhaps considered very high tech by the public, for example, rail and construction.</p>
<p>This app would save a great deal of time and resources, cutting down on overhead costs of printing and office supplies. The time saved alone would save the company both funds and stress on its employees which can only see an increase in productivity and revenue, something which the Rail industry is struggling with at the moment.</p>
