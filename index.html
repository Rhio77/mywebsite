<h2>About Me!</h2>
<p>I’m currently 44 and residing in country South Australia. I live with my partner and our sixteen year old son. We have other children, ages ranging in thier early to mid twenties and they're all off doing things and just generally being good people.
  My interests involve anything except sport. I love reading horror and scifi, crocheting, creating art and staying home.
  I still live in the same city I attended high school which means I also spend my time avoiding mlms started by fellow classmates.
  Interesting fact about me, I dabbled in stand-up after high school, not as a career per se but more to disappoint my parents. It worked. They sent me to Uni to be an accountant. That didn’t last long either.</p>
