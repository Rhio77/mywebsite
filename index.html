<h2>About Me!</h2>
<p>I’m currently 44 and residing in country South Australia. I live with my partner and our sixteen year old son. We have other children, ages ranging in thier early to mid twenties and they're all off doing things and just generally being good people.
  My interests involve anything except sport. I love reading horror and scifi, crocheting, creating art and staying home.
  I still live in the same city I attended high school which means I also spend my time avoiding mlms started by fellow classmates.
  Interesting fact about me, I dabbled in stand-up after high school, not as a career per se but more to disappoint my parents. It worked. They sent me to Uni to be an accountant. That didn’t last long either.</p>

<h2>Interest In IT</h2>
<p>My interest in IT started as a child, my dad was very interested in burgeoning technology, especially computers. Before then we have the latest in-home entertainment systems, the Beta VCR then the VHS. He never got into Laserdisc. Looked at it and laughed at how big the discs were. Our first computer was a Commodore 64 followed by the 128. Later, when I was in primary school, we had a dial up modem. It basically went from there. Part of my first grown-up pay was spent on a PlayStation One.
My past jobs have always centred around using computers. Social media and the internet are just a staple at this point. My dad passed away six years ago and now that I have the time and capability, I’m doing what I want to do.
My interest in attend RMIT stems from, once again, my dad. He had taken some RMIT classes when I was younger. When I started looking into Open Universities to see what my options were this course seemed like the best one available.
I want to learn the nuts and bolts of IT. I want to understand how it all works and hopefully find something I can be passionate about. I feel like my knowledge in computers and networking now is only at a rudimentary level and I want to take that next step. I want to learn about programming but I’m also keeping an open mind about what else could pique my interest.

<h2>My Ideal Job</h2>
<img src="Job1.jpg">
<p>Link https://au.indeed.com/jobs?q=programming&l=South%20Australia&vjk=ee658a1f2bb4400b</p>
<p>The position of Software Engineer with a company like the one listed in the advert interests me because I see so much software which has been designed to be tweaked and added to so that they can sell it to as many companies as possible. The result is a program that is neither user friendly nor intuitive. I am interested in creating software and mobility solutions for individual industries or businesses, tailor made to their requirements.
While I don’t necessarily have the exact skillset for this position now, by completing the Bachelor of IT and Programming further down the track, I will gain the required skills to do so.
One of the duties calls for an understanding of confidentiality, something I’m well versed in having worked for several government departments including SA Health and ARTC. I have a high level of concentration and attention to detail when working with data.

<h2>Personality Tests</h2>
<h3>Briggs-Meyers</h3>

<p>While this test can be described as somewhat correct, I feel that the results are too oversimplified. My attitude towards group work depends on many factors. Who am I working with? Do I feel like the outcome is achievable? Is everyone involved on the same level, are they going to put as much effort as possible into the project? Am I personally in the right frame of mind to be undertaking the work? Not every project is the same, not every group works together the same.</p>


<h3>Online Learning Style Test</h3>

<p>The fact I got a different result with this test, despite answering the questions is a very similar manner, doesn’t show me that they have much validity in many aspects, much less in a work situation. This one is a little closer to my work style though, I do find I get more achieved when I’m working by myself but I also value communication over anything else.</p>


<h3>Additional Online Test</h3>

<p>The results of these tests don’t mean a great deal to me. Some of the answers I gave made me realise that maybe I could afford to be more flexible with team members. I know I prefer to work alone but I’m also comfortable working in a team. The questions aren’t nuanced enough to drill down how any one person thinks or feels. It’s not going affect how I work or how I cooperate with people. I’ve been in the workforce for over twenty years, my experience overrides a ten minute test.</p>
