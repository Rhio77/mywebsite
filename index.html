<h2>About Me!</h2>
<p>I’m currently 44 and residing in country South Australia. I live with my partner and our sixteen year old son. We have other children, ages ranging in thier early to mid twenties and they're all off doing things and just generally being good people.
  My interests involve anything except sport. I love reading horror and scifi, crocheting, creating art and staying home.
  I still live in the same city I attended high school which means I also spend my time avoiding mlms started by fellow classmates.
  Interesting fact about me, I dabbled in stand-up after high school, not as a career per se but more to disappoint my parents. It worked. They sent me to Uni to be an accountant. That didn’t last long either.</p>

<h2>Interest In IT</h2>
<p>My interest in IT started as a child, my dad was very interested in burgeoning technology, especially computers. Before then we have the latest in-home entertainment systems, the Beta VCR then the VHS. He never got into Laserdisc. Looked at it and laughed at how big the discs were. Our first computer was a Commodore 64 followed by the 128. Later, when I was in primary school, we had a dial up modem. It basically went from there. Part of my first grown-up pay was spent on a PlayStation One.
My past jobs have always centred around using computers. Social media and the internet are just a staple at this point. My dad passed away six years ago and now that I have the time and capability, I’m doing what I want to do.
My interest in attend RMIT stems from, once again, my dad. He had taken some RMIT classes when I was younger. When I started looking into Open Universities to see what my options were this course seemed like the best one available.
I want to learn the nuts and bolts of IT. I want to understand how it all works and hopefully find something I can be passionate about. I feel like my knowledge in computers and networking now is only at a rudimentary level and I want to take that next step. I want to learn about programming but I’m also keeping an open mind about what else could pique my interest.
