<h2>About Me!</h2>
<p>I’m 44, born in Australia, child of a Welsh immigrant, wife, mother and dog owner. I work full time in the rail industry as a data admin. I enjoy reading, crocheting, creating art and staying home.
  I still live in the same city I attended high school which means I also spend my time avoiding mlms started by fellow classmates.
  Interesting fact about me, I dabbled in stand-up after high school, not as a career per se but more to disappoint my parents. It worked. They sent me to Uni to be an accountant. That didn’t last long either.</p>
